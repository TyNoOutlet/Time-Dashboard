## Japanese Time

Japanese Time is the closest replication of traditional Japanese timekeeping methods while being coherent in modern clocks. From the place file:

<blockquote>Japanese time breaks the day up into 12 hours, 6 in the daytime (卯, 辰, 巳, 午, 未, 申) and 6 for the nighttime (酉, 戌, 亥, 子, 丑, 寅). These hours are also referred to by number, starting with 子 being 9 down to 巳 being 4 and resetting to 9 with 午. The 6 daytime hours are tied to the hours of daylight, with the nighttime hours filling the nighttime gap. Hours are divided into koku (four per hour) and are not subdivided further; therefore, exact time is difficult to calculate. Since the time is based off of the beginning of twilight, the time in different locations varies greatly and must be reset on every solar term day.</blockquote>

Daytime 6 (卯), which starts the daytime, begins at the beginning of twilight, or within 15 minutes if one is located in a certain time zone. Likewise, nighttime 6 (酉) begins at the end of twilight, or within 15 minutes of it in a time zone.

In the latest update, there will be time zones that will correspond to a sunrise and sunset value of a region at (the map link will be here). Each time zone is named after the largest city in the zone: the city may be "Miami," but if you live in Homestead just an hour or less away, you will use a different time zone than Miami (most likely Key West or Tampa, actual time zone has not been drawn yet.) The time is updated automatically when the desired time zone is selected.

## Rokuyo

Rokuyo is a superstition from Edo-period Japan and onward. It is still used somewhat in modern culture. There are six days based on the lunar calendar. These six days are listed with explanations in the file.

## Customs

These are various holidays. There are four types: 
- US federal
- Japanese federal

Holidays deemed offensive or oppressive have been removed; similarly, any holidays that may not pass the Roblox filter have also been removed or have had name changes (the file is published on Roblox for online mobile viewing).
