## Japanese Time

Japanese Time is the closest replication of traditional Japanese timekeeping methods while being coherent in modern clocks. From the place file:

<blockquote>Japanese time breaks the day up into 12 hours, 6 in the daytime (卯, 辰, 巳, 午, 未, 申) and 6 for the nighttime (酉, 戌, 亥, 子, 丑, 寅). These hours are also referred to by number, starting with 子 being 9 down to 巳 being 4 and resetting to 9 with 午. The 6 daytime hours are tied to the hours of daylight, with the nighttime hours filling the nighttime gap. Hours are divided into koku (four per hour) and are not subdivided further; therefore, exact time is difficult to calculate. Since the time is based off of the beginning of twilight, the time in different locations varies greatly and must be reset on every solar term day.</blockquote>

Daytime 6 (卯), which starts the daytime, begins at the beginning of twilight, or within 15 minutes if one is located in a certain time zone. Likewise, nighttime 6 (酉) begins at the end of twilight, or within 15 minutes of it in a time zone.

In the latest update, there will be time zones that will correspond to a sunrise and sunset value of a region. Each time zone is based on regions of an area; you will select the country, state/province/similar, then the county-equivalent you want to view. The county-equivalent you select will be tied to a region; these regions change every solar term. The time is updated automatically when the desired county-equivalent is selected.

## Rokuyo

Rokuyo is a superstition from Edo-period Japan and onward. It is still used somewhat in modern culture. There are six days based on the lunar calendar. These six days are listed with explanations in the file.
